##Comprehensive Image Preprocessing and Coin Detection using OpenCV
##Introduction
This repository contains code for a Python application that performs comprehensive image preprocessing and coin detection using the OpenCV library. The code is organized into several tasks, each serving a crucial role in the process of detecting and counting coins within an input image ('coin.png').

##Tasks
##Task 1: Image Resizing
The initial step focuses on resizing the input image to a uniform 300x300 pixel size. This standardization simplifies subsequent processing. It utilizes the cv.resize() function with the cv.INTER_AREA interpolation method for high-quality resizing.

##Task 2: Grayscale Conversion
After resizing, the code converts the image to grayscale using the cv.cvtColor() function with the cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY flag. Grayscale conversion simplifies the image to a single channel, preparing it for further processing.

##Task 3: Binarization
The grayscale image undergoes binarization, converting it into a binary image with pixel values of either black (0) or white (255). This task employs the cv.threshold() function with a threshold value of 160, highlighting coin shapes against the background.

##Task 4: Coin Detection
The core task involves coin detection using OpenCV's SimpleBlobDetector class. Key parameters are configured:

filterByArea is enabled to filter blobs based on their area (100 to 100,000 pixels).
filterByColor is activated to detect dark objects on a light background.
A detector instance is created using cv.SimpleBlobDetector_create(), and coins are detected in the binary image.

##Task 5: Visualization and Counting
The code draws circles around detected coins using cv.drawKeypoints(), providing visual feedback. It also calculates the total number of detected coins by determining the length of the keypoints list. The output image is annotated with the coin count using cv.putText().

##Conclusion
This code demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for image preprocessing and coin detection using OpenCV. It can be adapted for various applications, such as coin recognition and sorting. Its modular structure makes it a valuable tool for coin-related image processing tasks.
